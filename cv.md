**About Myself:**

I like programming, I study it almost every day, I try to spend about 30 hours a week. My desire is to become a real junior developer and get my first job.

I'm interested in web development because this profession provides endless opportunities for professional growth.
In addition, there are a huge number of free, high-quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an experienced front-end developer.

#### **Code example:**
**KATA from CODEWARS:**
Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.

**Task Overview:**

You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

- ```cap``` is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
- ```on``` is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
- ```wait``` is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

```
function enough(cap, on, wait) {
  
  if(cap>= (on + wait)) {
    
    return 0
  } else  {
    
    return on + wait - cap;
  }
}
```
